# LinuxCNCConfig
WIP Configs for the CNC machine

### Entrypoint is the PrintNC.ini file. The rest of the HAL is loaded from there.

There are some redundant files in here from when we were trying to the the VFD working with Modbus.
We've settled on 0-10v control for now until we source a nicer VFD
